Programming	Assignment	#2
Trivia/Flash	Card																																																																 Due:	Tuesday,	February	24th
For	this	assignment,	you	are	to	create	either	a	trivia	game	or	study	aid	(e.g.	flash	
card	system).		There	must	be	at	least	two	different	types	of	trivia	or	study	topics.
The	app	should	contain	at	least	three	activities—an	opening	(splash)	screen	that	
allows	the	user	to	pick	a	trivia	or	study	topic.		Each	topic	should	launch	a	separate	
activity.		Each	topic	must	present	the	user	with	a	question	and	count	the	number	
correct	from	the	number	of	questions	presented.		The	user	should	be	provided	
questions	until	he	or	she	decides	to	finish/go	back	to	splash	screen.		The	total	points	
earned	and	total	questions	asked	should	be	sent back	to	the	main	activity,	which	
should	keep	track	of	how	many	questions	asked	and	answered	correctly	in	each	
topic.		The	user	may	then	work	on	a	different	topic	and	then	return	to	the	previous	
topic.		The	main	activity	should	keep	running	totals	for	each	topic	and	a	grand	total	
of	questions	asked	and	answered	correctly.
Suggestion:		Make	one	topic	math	so	that	you	can	randomly	generate	an	unlimited	
number	of	questions.
At	least	one	topic	must	load	questions/answers	from the	XML	“values”.		Maybe	you	
want	to	quiz	on	state	capitals.		You	can,	for	example,	include	the	question	and	
answer	as	a	single,	parse-able	string,	such	as	“Mississippi:Jackson”.		You	could	
randomly	give	a	capital	and	ask	for	the	state	or	provide	the	state	and	ask	for	the	
capital.
One	option	on	the	main	activity	should	be	to	reset	the	points.
The	app	will	be	judged	by	the	functionality	(does	it	work),	the	user	interface, and	
your	creativity in	making	it	fun	to	use.
In	order	to	help	the	grader	(and me)	please	use	P2<webid>	as	the	Application	name	
and	<webid>.olemiss.edu	for	company	domain.		So	my	Application	name	would	be	
P2dwilkins and	I	would	use	dwilkins.olemiss.edu as	the	company	domain	
(package	name	edu.olemiss.edwilkins.p2dwilkins).
Submit	your solution	to	Blackboard	as	Prog2
